> "Technology should solve problems, not create them. My code is my craft, user experience is my compass, and mentoring is my legacy."

Throughout my career, I've been committed to not just building great software, but also to lifting others up. When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new architectural patterns, experimenting with AI/ML integrations, capturing moments through photography 📸, or contributing to causes in education and charity 🌍.
