I am a versatile, hands-on developer with a project history of over 10 years, working from concept to delivery. Conversant in a range of technologies - most notably .NET and SQL - I follow the industry trends with considerable dedication. My approach is methodical yet creative, and I seek to code to the highest possible standard. A confident communicator, I am comfortable working either independently or as part of a team.
